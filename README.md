# Veil
### A space for inclusive ideation
Veil is a real time feed that small groups or organizations can use to anonymously contribute and react to ideas. We believe ideas should be judged solely on their basis as an idea, free from any bias towards or against the person submitting them. As an entry to the Lady Problems Hackathon, we wanted to contribute a tool that eliminated the institutionalized bias against women when they want to give their input.
